# Summary of Findings
Based on the data visualization filtered to 2023, **Leaf & Bloom Co.**'s performance can be summarized as follows:

1. **Top Performing Markets:**
   - **Portugal and the Philippines** are the top-performing countries in terms of sales. These markets are crucial for driving overall company revenue.
   - Other significant contributors include **Colombia, Brazil, and Canada**, which also show strong performance but are slightly behind the top two.

2. **Year-to-Date (YTD) vs. Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD) Analysis:**
   - There was a **mixed performance** throughout the year when comparing YTD sales with PYTD. 
   - The **strongest months** for growth compared to the previous year were **March and April**, indicating a possible seasonal trend or successful marketing/promotion efforts during these months.
   - However, there were **notable declines** in other months, particularly in **December**, which led to an overall decline in YTD performance compared to PYTD by **$512.26K**.

3. **Product Type Performance:**
   - **Outdoor products** showed consistent performance across the year, making them a reliable source of revenue.
   - **Indoor and Landscape products** experienced fluctuations, with indoor products peaking in the middle of the year. This indicates a possible **seasonal demand** or specific customer preferences during certain periods.

4. **Profitability Insights:**
   - The **scatter plot** reveals that while some accounts are high in sales, they may not be as profitable. There is a **need to balance** between driving sales and ensuring profitability.
   - Accounts with a **high Gross Profit Percentage (GP%)** and high sales value should be prioritized, as they contribute significantly to the company’s bottom line.

5. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **December's performance** needs investigation, as the decline in sales during this month significantly impacted the overall YTD vs. PYTD comparison. Understanding the cause of this drop could help in planning for future years.
   - **Increasing profitability** for accounts with lower GP% but higher sales should be a priority. This could involve re-evaluating pricing strategies, reducing costs, or offering premium services/products.

6. **Strategic Recommendations:**
   - **Focus on Top Markets:** Given the success in Portugal and the Philippines, it would be wise to allocate more resources to these markets, such as targeted marketing campaigns or expanding product offerings tailored to these regions.
   - **Capitalize on Seasonal Trends:** Use the insights from March and April to plan for future promotions or product launches during these peak months.
   - **Enhance Profitability:** Review lower GP% accounts and explore ways to increase their profitability, potentially through cost reduction or strategic upselling.


# Limitations

1. **Data Granularity:**
   - The visualizations are based on aggregated data, which might obscure finer details.
   - For instance, country-level analysis doesn't provide insights into regional or city-level performance, which could vary significantly within the same country.

2. **Temporal Limitations:**
    - The analysis focuses on year-over-year comparison (YTD vs. PYTD) without considering multi-year trends.
    - A broader historical context could reveal longer-term trends or anomalies that are not evident in a two-year comparison.

3. **Product Categorization:**
    - The product types (Indoor, Landscape, Outdoor) are broad categories.
    - More detailed segmentation within these categories (e.g., specific plant types or sizes) could offer deeper insights into which products are driving sales within each category.

4. **Seasonality Considerations:**
    - While seasonal trends are visible, the analysis does not fully account for external factors that might influence these trends, such as holidays, weather patterns, or economic conditions.
    - These factors could significantly impact sales but aren't directly represented in the data.
  
5. **Data Quality and Completeness:**
    - The accuracy of the visualizations depends on the quality and completeness of the underlying data.
    - If there are gaps, errors, or biases in the data, these will be reflected in the visualizations and insights.
